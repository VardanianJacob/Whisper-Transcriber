<h3>SPEAKER_01 <small>(00:01)</small></h3>
<p>I want to set a recorder.</p>
<h3>SPEAKER_01 <small>(00:03)</small></h3>
<p>Okay, this is a recorder.</p>
<h3>SPEAKER_00 <small>(00:08)</small></h3>
<p>It says enter passcode.</p>
<h3>SPEAKER_00 <small>(00:10)</small></h3>
<p>What?</p>
<h3>SPEAKER_00 <small>(00:11)</small></h3>
<p>It says enter passcode.</p>
<h3>SPEAKER_01 <small>(00:13)</small></h3>
<p>Okay.</p>
<h3>SPEAKER_01 <small>(00:15)</small></h3>
<p>Okay guys, so pick the number.</p>
<h3>SPEAKER_00 <small>(00:20)</small></h3>
<p>55.</p>
<h3>SPEAKER_01 <small>(00:28)</small></h3>
<p>A teammate submitted a pool request with bad code quality.</p>
<h3>SPEAKER_01 <small>(00:33)</small></h3>
<p>How would you handle this situation?</p>
<h3>SPEAKER_00 <small>(00:38)</small></h3>
<p>Okay, if I were a team leader, of course I would set a process of code reviewing prior to submitting any code to push it into</p>
<h3>SPEAKER_00 <small>(00:51)</small></h3>
<p>let's say develop branch.</p>
<h3>SPEAKER_00 <small>(00:55)</small></h3>
<p>And even if the poor code got into it, I would definitely review it as a team leader to check</p>
<h3>SPEAKER_00 <small>(01:05)</small></h3>
<p>if everything is correct, everything is</p>
<h3>SPEAKER_00 <small>(01:10)</small></h3>
<p>suits the code style of our company and is logically correct.</p>
<h3>SPEAKER_00 <small>(01:17)</small></h3>
<p>And most of, let's say, if I saw something poor in this code, I would reject this pool with some comments in Git.</p>
<h3>SPEAKER_00 <small>(01:32)</small></h3>
<p>Or,</p>
<h3>SPEAKER_00 <small>(01:33)</small></h3>
<p>Let's say I was stressed and frustrated with some other tasks and I did notice this bad quality of the code and it got into the branch.</p>
<h3>SPEAKER_00 <small>(01:49)</small></h3>
<p>I would simply reverse it because in Git there is an opportunity to roll back, yeah.</p>
<h3>SPEAKER_00 <small>(02:00)</small></h3>
<p>Any pool requests?</p>
<h3>SPEAKER_00 <small>(02:02)</small></h3>
<p>And yeah, I would just request.</p>
<h3>SPEAKER_02 <small>(02:05)</small></h3>
<p>I think I want to add something.</p>
<h3>SPEAKER_02 <small>(02:07)</small></h3>
<p>Pool request means that you, one of the developers work in the different branch,</p>
<h3>SPEAKER_02 <small>(02:14)</small></h3>
<p>different from develop or</p>
<h3>SPEAKER_02 <small>(02:17)</small></h3>
<p>yes usually we call the develop branch and when he is doing pull request means he is kind of</p>
<h3>SPEAKER_02 <small>(02:23)</small></h3>
<p>asking permission from the other to merge it to the develop branch so full request means that</p>
<h3>SPEAKER_02 <small>(02:31)</small></h3>
<p>the code is not in the developed branch yet you see some drawbacks there and you need to</p>
<h3>SPEAKER_02 <small>(02:38)</small></h3>
<p>either add some comments what to improve or to fix or rejected some</p>
<h3>SPEAKER_00 <small>(02:47)</small></h3>
<p>Okay, and what was the question?</p>
<h3>SPEAKER_00 <small>(02:49)</small></h3>
<p>So it's already pooled or is...</p>
<h3>SPEAKER_01 <small>(02:51)</small></h3>
<p>The question is you have to handle the situation when your teammate submitted a pool request with a bad code quality.</p>
<h3>SPEAKER_01 <small>(02:58)</small></h3>
<p>Oh, okay.</p>
<h3>SPEAKER_01 <small>(02:59)</small></h3>
<p>And yeah, I think one of the possible answers could be I would discuss the issues in the pool request and suggest improvements.</p>
<h3>SPEAKER_01 <small>(03:09)</small></h3>
<p>And I'm going to ask you guys to introduce yourself.</p>
<h3>SPEAKER_01 <small>(03:12)</small></h3>
<p>This is just for AI analyzing.</p>
<h3>SPEAKER_01 <small>(03:15)</small></h3>
<p>It's much easier than just separated by it.</p>
<h3>SPEAKER_01 <small>(03:19)</small></h3>
<p>Okay.</p>
<h3>SPEAKER_00 <small>(03:19)</small></h3>
<p>So.</p>
<h3>SPEAKER_00 <small>(03:19)</small></h3>
<p>I'm Anton.</p>
<h3>SPEAKER_00 <small>(03:20)</small></h3>
<p>I'm a project manager.</p>
<h3>SPEAKER_00 <small>(03:23)</small></h3>
<p>I live in Yerevan for almost three years and that's it.</p>
<h3>SPEAKER_01 <small>(03:27)</small></h3>
<p>You can just use your name, please, not your biography.</p>
<h3>SPEAKER_02 <small>(03:32)</small></h3>
<p>I'm Anna, I'm a product analyst currently.</p>
<h3>SPEAKER_02 <small>(03:36)</small></h3>
<p>Also, I was an economist and game developer earlier.</p>
<h3>SPEAKER_02 <small>(03:42)</small></h3>
<p>I live in Yerevan for five years.</p>
<h3>SPEAKER_01 <small>(03:45)</small></h3>
<p>Yeah, it's okay, guys.</p>
<h3>SPEAKER_01 <small>(03:47)</small></h3>
<p>You can't just say your name or just...</p>
<h3>SPEAKER_02 <small>(03:50)</small></h3>
<p>Ah, okay, okay, okay.</p>
<h3>SPEAKER_02 <small>(03:51)</small></h3>
<p>I didn't know.</p>
<h3>SPEAKER_01 <small>(03:53)</small></h3>
<p>It's easier to separate the results, the report.</p>
<h3>SPEAKER_00 <small>(03:56)</small></h3>
<p>Okay.</p>
<h3>SPEAKER_00 <small>(03:56)</small></h3>
<p>The voices.</p>
<h3>SPEAKER_01 <small>(03:59)</small></h3>
<p>So, okay, and let's continue with you.</p>
<h3>SPEAKER_02 <small>(04:02)</small></h3>
<p>Big number.</p>
<h3>SPEAKER_02 <small>(04:03)</small></h3>
<p>Seventeen.</p>
<h3>SPEAKER_00 <small>(04:06)</small></h3>
<p>The same is Oleg?</p>
<h3>SPEAKER_02 <small>(04:09)</small></h3>
<p>I think he chose seven now.</p>
<h3>SPEAKER_01 <small>(04:12)</small></h3>
<p>No?</p>
<h3>SPEAKER_01 <small>(04:12)</small></h3>
<p>Let's don't go that way.</p>
<h3>SPEAKER_02 <small>(04:15)</small></h3>
<p>He chose that.</p>
<h3>SPEAKER_01 <small>(04:17)</small></h3>
<p>Seventy.</p>
<h3>SPEAKER_00 <small>(04:17)</small></h3>
<p>I can choose 70.</p>
<h3>SPEAKER_01 <small>(04:18)</small></h3>
<p>You just spent too much time.</p>
<h3>SPEAKER_00 <small>(04:22)</small></h3>
<p>Discussing.</p>
<h3>SPEAKER_00 <small>(04:22)</small></h3>
<p>Okay, okay.</p>
<h3>SPEAKER_00 <small>(04:23)</small></h3>
<p>Sorry, sorry.</p>
<h3>SPEAKER_01 <small>(04:23)</small></h3>
<p>I was bothered with this conversation.</p>
<h3>SPEAKER_02 <small>(04:25)</small></h3>
<p>No, he chose 17.</p>
<h3>SPEAKER_02 <small>(04:27)</small></h3>
<p>Seventy.</p>
<h3>SPEAKER_02 <small>(04:28)</small></h3>
<p>I chose 17.</p>
<h3>SPEAKER_01 <small>(04:29)</small></h3>
<p>I can't hear that anymore.</p>
<h3>SPEAKER_01 <small>(04:31)</small></h3>
<p>Please stop.</p>
<h3>SPEAKER_04 <small>(04:32)</small></h3>
<p>Continue, please.</p>
<h3>SPEAKER_01 <small>(04:34)</small></h3>
<p>17, 17.</p>
<h3>SPEAKER_01 <small>(04:35)</small></h3>
<p>70 is like, come, guys, stop.</p>
<h3>SPEAKER_01 <small>(04:39)</small></h3>
<p>Okay, have you ever worked in a cross-functional team?</p>
<h3>SPEAKER_01 <small>(04:43)</small></h3>
<p>How was the experience?</p>
<h3>SPEAKER_02 <small>(04:47)</small></h3>
<p>If I get correctly, what means cross-functional team?</p>
<h3>SPEAKER_02 <small>(04:51)</small></h3>
<p>I think, yes, I worked because they were people with different specializations.</p>
<h3>SPEAKER_02 <small>(05:00)</small></h3>
<p>For example, I was a developer and in the same team where was a game designer and artist.</p>
<h3>SPEAKER_02 <small>(05:10)</small></h3>
<p>I think overall experience was not bad, but sometimes there can be some communication issues.</p>
<h3>SPEAKER_02 <small>(05:18)</small></h3>
<p>Then you think that you understood your colleagues, but it turns out that not so.</p>
<h3>SPEAKER_02 <small>(05:25)</small></h3>
<p>So, I think that's it.</p>
<h3>SPEAKER_01 <small>(05:31)</small></h3>
<p>Okay, any questions to Anna?</p>
<h3>SPEAKER_01 <small>(05:36)</small></h3>
<p>One more thing, guys. Try to speak loud.</p>
<h3>SPEAKER_01 <small>(05:42)</small></h3>
<p>This is actually applies to Agop and to Anna.</p>
<h3>SPEAKER_01 <small>(05:46)</small></h3>
<p>Because, you know, when you speak louder, you're, you know, act like more confident.</p>
<h3>SPEAKER_01 <small>(05:54)</small></h3>
<p>You look like more confident in that way and the opposite side understand you better in that case.</p>
<h3>SPEAKER_01 <small>(06:02)</small></h3>
<p>So, and try not to wash.</p>
<h3>SPEAKER_01 <small>(06:05)</small></h3>
<p>Okay.</p>
<h3>SPEAKER_01 <small>(06:06)</small></h3>
<p>Louder.</p>
<h3>SPEAKER_00 <small>(06:11)</small></h3>
<p>basic presentation skills yeah really in the interview you have to sell because</p>
<h3>SPEAKER_01 <small>(06:19)</small></h3>
<p>just try to just try to catch the best things he does while he's speaking he do it louder</p>
<h3>SPEAKER_01 <small>(06:28)</small></h3>
<p>he does it confident he do it not so fast</p>
<h3>SPEAKER_00 <small>(06:33)</small></h3>
<p>because I can do it fast.</p>
<h3>SPEAKER_01 <small>(06:35)</small></h3>
<p>Okay, sometimes I cannot catch what a copse.</p>
<h3>SPEAKER_01 <small>(06:40)</small></h3>
<p>So, but when you do it more,</p>
<h3>SPEAKER_01 <small>(06:45)</small></h3>
<p>slowly I can understand you.</p>
<h3>SPEAKER_01 <small>(06:47)</small></h3>
<p>Speak up. Don't be afraid guys, just speak up.</p>
<h3>SPEAKER_01 <small>(06:52)</small></h3>
<p>I made a lot of mistakes while I'm explaining you what you are to involve.</p>
<h3>SPEAKER_02 <small>(06:57)</small></h3>
<p>I just don't feel that I'm talking very low loud.</p>
<h3>SPEAKER_01 <small>(07:01)</small></h3>
<p>Maybe.</p>
<h3>SPEAKER_00 <small>(07:02)</small></h3>
<p>Yeah, actually I see really close to you and I have to...</p>
<h3>SPEAKER_00 <small>(07:07)</small></h3>
<p>Listen.</p>
<h3>SPEAKER_00 <small>(07:09)</small></h3>
<p>Hard focusing what you are.</p>
<h3>SPEAKER_00 <small>(07:11)</small></h3>
<p>Stress my listening skills.</p>
<h3>SPEAKER_02 <small>(07:13)</small></h3>
<p>Okay.</p>
<h3>SPEAKER_00 <small>(07:14)</small></h3>
<p>Okay.</p>
<h3>SPEAKER_01 <small>(07:16)</small></h3>
<p>Maybe you can...</p>
<h3>SPEAKER_00 <small>(07:17)</small></h3>
<p>But this is right thing.</p>
<h3>SPEAKER_01 <small>(07:18)</small></h3>
<p>Maybe you can actually practice at a tone trying to just scream in sometimes.</p>
<h3>SPEAKER_01 <small>(07:25)</small></h3>
<p>I don't know.</p>
<h3>SPEAKER_01 <small>(07:27)</small></h3>
<p>It will be able to.</p>
<h3>SPEAKER_01 <small>(07:27)</small></h3>
<p>Just try to record yourself and just very good.</p>
<h3>SPEAKER_01 <small>(07:33)</small></h3>
<p>Really makes you more confident while you're talking.</p>
<h3>SPEAKER_01 <small>(07:37)</small></h3>
<p>Okay, Alyssa.</p>
<h3>SPEAKER_03 <small>(07:38)</small></h3>
<p>Eleven.</p>
<h3>SPEAKER_01 <small>(07:39)</small></h3>
<p>Eleven.</p>
<h3>SPEAKER_00 <small>(07:41)</small></h3>
<p>Eleven.</p>
<h3>SPEAKER_00 <small>(07:41)</small></h3>
<p>Only, sir.</p>
<h3>SPEAKER_01 <small>(07:44)</small></h3>
<p>What do you consider your biggest professional achievement?</p>
<h3>SPEAKER_03 <small>(07:49)</small></h3>
<p>Hmm.</p>
<h3>SPEAKER_03 <small>(07:51)</small></h3>
<p>Very difficult questions.</p>
<h3>SPEAKER_03 <small>(07:53)</small></h3>
<p>My biggest achievement, I think it's when I can come through a whole process of project implementation or</p>
<h3>SPEAKER_03 <small>(08:21)</small></h3>
<p>product and to see a whole scenario what have to be implemented in project or in product.</p>
<h3>SPEAKER_03 <small>(08:36)</small></h3>
<p>And when I understand all of it and I can explain it to other team mates,</p>
<h3>SPEAKER_03 <small>(08:46)</small></h3>
<p>I think it's a big achievement for me in each product and project.</p>
<h3>SPEAKER_01 <small>(08:54)</small></h3>
<p>So what was the achievement actually I didn't catch?</p>
<h3>SPEAKER_03 <small>(09:04)</small></h3>
<p>I tried to explain another way.</p>
<h3>SPEAKER_03 <small>(09:09)</small></h3>
<p>When I deep dive into some project on some project,</p>
<h3>SPEAKER_03 <small>(09:15)</small></h3>
<p>I try to learn a lot about it,</p>
<h3>SPEAKER_03 <small>(09:21)</small></h3>
<p>and to understand each step of processes.</p>
<h3>SPEAKER_03 <small>(09:28)</small></h3>
<p>And to understand, I don't know, so to say,</p>
<h3>SPEAKER_01 <small>(09:36)</small></h3>
<p>judges,</p>
<h3>SPEAKER_00 <small>(09:41)</small></h3>
<p>like, I don't know how to say.</p>
<h3>SPEAKER_00 <small>(09:42)</small></h3>
<p>Common vision?</p>
<h3>SPEAKER_03 <small>(09:43)</small></h3>
<p>Ah, yes, thank you.</p>
<h3>SPEAKER_03 <small>(09:44)</small></h3>
<p>A high level vision of product or project.</p>
<h3>SPEAKER_01 <small>(09:49)</small></h3>
<p>Well, it's not sounds like an achievement, you know.</p>
<h3>SPEAKER_01 <small>(09:52)</small></h3>
<p>It sounds like the way you are working.</p>
<h3>SPEAKER_01 <small>(09:56)</small></h3>
<p>So this is your approaches during your work.</p>
<h3>SPEAKER_01 <small>(10:00)</small></h3>
<p>So it's not an achievement.</p>
<h3>SPEAKER_01 <small>(10:02)</small></h3>
<p>Achievement and when you achieve some goals,</p>
<h3>SPEAKER_01 <small>(10:05)</small></h3>
<p>when you get some results.</p>
<h3>SPEAKER_00 <small>(10:07)</small></h3>
<p>Can I give quick feedback to you?</p>
<h3>SPEAKER_00 <small>(10:10)</small></h3>
<p>Try to consider the STAR method, which states for situation, task, action and results,</p>
<h3>SPEAKER_00 <small>(10:15)</small></h3>
<p>basically.</p>
<h3>SPEAKER_00 <small>(10:17)</small></h3>
<p>And the last point is result.</p>
<h3>SPEAKER_03 <small>(10:21)</small></h3>
<p>I think I forget about this method.</p>
<h3>SPEAKER_01 <small>(10:26)</small></h3>
<p>So achievement is the result?</p>
<h3>SPEAKER_01 <small>(10:28)</small></h3>
<p>What company get after that?</p>
<h3>SPEAKER_02 <small>(10:30)</small></h3>
<p>It's all like, it's not really.</p>
<h3>SPEAKER_00 <small>(10:31)</small></h3>
<p>Yeah, when you're talking about yourself, talk about like it was a situation.</p>
<h3>SPEAKER_03 <small>(10:36)</small></h3>
<p>Guys, guys.</p>
<h3>SPEAKER_03 <small>(10:36)</small></h3>
<p>I try one more time.</p>
<h3>SPEAKER_03 <small>(10:40)</small></h3>
<p>It was a big challenge when a project manager comes to a company.</p>
<h3>SPEAKER_03 <small>(10:50)</small></h3>
<p>came to me and asked to be to implement one project in three weeks while usually</p>
<h3>SPEAKER_03 <small>(11:01)</small></h3>
<p>it takes about three months and he asked me to be in three roles at the same time I was</p>
<h3>SPEAKER_03 <small>(11:16)</small></h3>
<p>team lead of analysts, project manager of this project and business system analysts too.</p>
<h3>SPEAKER_03 <small>(11:23)</small></h3>
<p>And I gathered my team and</p>
<h3>SPEAKER_03 <small>(11:33)</small></h3>
<p>assign and explain them that we need to implement this project in a very short time and divide them</p>
<h3>SPEAKER_03 <small>(11:46)</small></h3>
<p>and controlled it and we</p>
<h3>SPEAKER_03 <small>(11:53)</small></h3>
<p>Managed to meet the deadline, maybe with some small technical depth, but we can meet deadline.</p>
<h3>SPEAKER_00 <small>(12:07)</small></h3>
<p>Quick thing about pronunciation, not depth, but debt.</p>
<h3>SPEAKER_03 <small>(12:10)</small></h3>
<p>Dead, yeah.</p>
<h3>SPEAKER_01 <small>(12:12)</small></h3>
<p>Depth, yeah.</p>
<h3>SPEAKER_01 <small>(12:13)</small></h3>
<p>Depth is like...</p>
<h3>SPEAKER_01 <small>(12:16)</small></h3>
<p>Okay.</p>
<h3>SPEAKER_01 <small>(12:18)</small></h3>
<p>So, and say your name please.</p>
<h3>SPEAKER_03 <small>(12:20)</small></h3>
<p>Alisa.</p>
<h3>SPEAKER_01 <small>(12:21)</small></h3>
<p>My name is...</p>
<h3>SPEAKER_03 <small>(12:22)</small></h3>
<p>My name is Alisa.</p>
<h3>SPEAKER_01 <small>(12:25)</small></h3>
<p>Okay, yeah, good.</p>
<h3>SPEAKER_01 <small>(12:27)</small></h3>
<p>One of the possible answers could be my biggest achievement was leading a project that increased efficiency by 30% in my company.</p>
<h3>SPEAKER_01 <small>(12:36)</small></h3>
<p>So sure.</p>
<h3>SPEAKER_01 <small>(12:38)</small></h3>
<p>understandable and after that HR probably can ask you like tell me more about that</p>
<h3>SPEAKER_01 <small>(12:45)</small></h3>
<p>achievement right and you go deep down diving the details and explain what exactly</p>
<h3>SPEAKER_01 <small>(12:51)</small></h3>
<p>you did so one of my my experience showed me that you shouldn't go to</p>
<h3>SPEAKER_01 <small>(13:00)</small></h3>
<p>deep dive in the details, not should go so really deep.</p>
<h3>SPEAKER_01 <small>(13:06)</small></h3>
<p>So you have to, in first iteration, try to explain it with more high-level way,</p>
<h3>SPEAKER_01 <small>(13:13)</small></h3>
<p>high-level view, right?</p>
<h3>SPEAKER_01 <small>(13:15)</small></h3>
<p>What was your achievement?</p>
<h3>SPEAKER_01 <small>(13:17)</small></h3>
<p>So we have to really use the star method.</p>
<h3>SPEAKER_01 <small>(13:20)</small></h3>
<p>So maybe, Anton, you want to explain a little more about...</p>
<h3>SPEAKER_00 <small>(13:23)</small></h3>
<p>Again, about Star method.</p>
<h3>SPEAKER_00 <small>(13:27)</small></h3>
<p>You want to use this framework as a prism of how you describe yourself,</p>
<h3>SPEAKER_00 <small>(13:34)</small></h3>
<p>basically how you say yourself.</p>
<h3>SPEAKER_00 <small>(13:37)</small></h3>
<p>You don't say, I was, let's say, managing projects and cross-functional tips,</p>
<h3>SPEAKER_00 <small>(13:43)</small></h3>
<p>because it's obvious as a project manager you should do this.</p>
<h3>SPEAKER_00 <small>(13:46)</small></h3>
<p>But what exactly did you do with cross-functional tips?</p>
<h3>SPEAKER_00 <small>(13:51)</small></h3>
<p>What was the situation?</p>
<h3>SPEAKER_00 <small>(13:53)</small></h3>
<p>What did you do and what was the outcome?</p>
<h3>SPEAKER_00 <small>(13:56)</small></h3>
<p>And basically each of your positions in each of your companies,</p>
<h3>SPEAKER_00 <small>(14:01)</small></h3>
<p>you should describe yourself using this framework.</p>
<h3>SPEAKER_01 <small>(14:05)</small></h3>
<p>Explain abbreviations.</p>
<h3>SPEAKER_00 <small>(14:07)</small></h3>
<p>Abbreviations.</p>
<h3>SPEAKER_00 <small>(14:08)</small></h3>
<p>So, situation, task, action, and results.</p>
<h3>SPEAKER_01 <small>(14:13)</small></h3>
<p>T, what does it mean T?</p>
<h3>SPEAKER_00 <small>(14:15)</small></h3>
<p>Task.</p>
<h3>SPEAKER_00 <small>(14:16)</small></h3>
<p>So let's say there was a...</p>
<h3>SPEAKER_01 <small>(14:19)</small></h3>
<p>So, for example, we need to deploy our product in two months.</p>
<h3>SPEAKER_01 <small>(14:25)</small></h3>
<p>yeah it was a product too so task this is what the task is maybe the</p>
<h3>SPEAKER_00 <small>(14:34)</small></h3>
<p>maybe situation can be a bit different like i was a project manager this is a situation</p>
<h3>SPEAKER_00 <small>(14:39)</small></h3>
<p>maybe a project came with a very tight deadline</p>
<h3>SPEAKER_00 <small>(14:43)</small></h3>
<p>So the customer came with a really tight deadline.</p>
<h3>SPEAKER_00 <small>(14:47)</small></h3>
<p>Much tighter than the usual clients, this is the situation.</p>
<h3>SPEAKER_00 <small>(14:50)</small></h3>
<p>Then tasks.</p>
<h3>SPEAKER_00 <small>(14:50)</small></h3>
<p>So we had to accomplish this task, this project, in three weeks.</p>
<h3>SPEAKER_00 <small>(14:56)</small></h3>
<p>It was the task.</p>
<h3>SPEAKER_00 <small>(14:58)</small></h3>
<p>Then action.</p>
<h3>SPEAKER_00 <small>(15:01)</small></h3>
<p>We planned it really thoroughly broke down, yeah, and we implemented some cool framework.</p>
<h3>SPEAKER_00 <small>(15:10)</small></h3>
<p>Probably some of the main functionality, etc.</p>
<h3>SPEAKER_00 <small>(15:14)</small></h3>
<p>Use some boosters, for example, to achieve this task in three weeks.</p>
<h3>SPEAKER_00 <small>(15:18)</small></h3>
<p>We did action.</p>
<h3>SPEAKER_00 <small>(15:21)</small></h3>
<p>and we coded, we like, added new resources, and as a result, we managed to do this</p>
<h3>SPEAKER_00 <small>(15:31)</small></h3>
<p>in, not in three weeks, but in four weeks with a very good quality.</p>
<h3>SPEAKER_01 <small>(15:36)</small></h3>
<p>Beautiful technique, I think, right?</p>
<h3>SPEAKER_01 <small>(15:38)</small></h3>
<p>So this is a really beautiful technique you can use all the time.</p>
<h3>SPEAKER_00 <small>(15:42)</small></h3>
<p>You should use it all time.</p>
<h3>SPEAKER_02 <small>(15:45)</small></h3>
<p>What is that advantage of it?</p>
<h3>SPEAKER_02 <small>(15:49)</small></h3>
<p>I knew about this technique and when I was preparing to interview questions I also tried to make...</p>
<h3>SPEAKER_00 <small>(15:57)</small></h3>
<p>Because consider yourself as a tool for a company.</p>
<h3>SPEAKER_00 <small>(16:00)</small></h3>
<p>You are a tool, first of all.</p>
<h3>SPEAKER_00 <small>(16:03)</small></h3>
<p>You are a tool to achieve company's goals, to succeed in your role.</p>
<h3>SPEAKER_00 <small>(16:09)</small></h3>
<p>and you should show that previously in your experience you already somehow made a company</p>
<h3>SPEAKER_00 <small>(16:18)</small></h3>
<p>brought some value to this company so you basically should like it's a maybe selling technique as well but</p>
<h3>SPEAKER_00 <small>(16:27)</small></h3>
<p>recruiters managers they just want to know but you need to sorry but what</p>
<h3>SPEAKER_02 <small>(16:31)</small></h3>
<p>I need to give a little bit context about the problem problem you solved</p>
<h3>SPEAKER_00 <small>(16:37)</small></h3>
<p>yeah the situation is the first situation is the first thing you give it context</p>
<h3>SPEAKER_02 <small>(16:42)</small></h3>
<p>it's kind of a little script how to describe your achievements in order it be not very big</p>
<h3>SPEAKER_02 <small>(16:51)</small></h3>
<p>big but more short shorter but understandable and a cool technique is to write it down</p>
<h3>SPEAKER_00 <small>(17:03)</small></h3>
<p>manually write it down then maybe transcribe it turn the text into audio and then tweak some things</p>
<h3>SPEAKER_00 <small>(17:10)</small></h3>
<p>as an affirmation yeah this is actually it is yeah you have to practice with this</p>
<h3>SPEAKER_01 <small>(17:16)</small></h3>
<p>it's like a self pitch basically yeah really okay nice so macoc your turn</p>
<h3>SPEAKER_04 <small>(17:27)</small></h3>
<p>Before I did I took my name is Hargop</p>
<h3>SPEAKER_01 <small>(17:30)</small></h3>
<p>Okay, yeah nice</p>
<h3>SPEAKER_01 <small>(17:35)</small></h3>
<p>How do you approach problem solving when working on a tight deadlines?</p>
<h3>SPEAKER_01 <small>(17:46)</small></h3>
<p>Did you get the question?</p>
<h3>SPEAKER_04 <small>(17:48)</small></h3>
<p>Yeah, I understand it when I was some tired deadlines</p>
<h3>SPEAKER_04 <small>(17:52)</small></h3>
<p>I need to finish it or I need to tell clients from the end</p>
<h3>SPEAKER_04 <small>(17:58)</small></h3>
<p>Why I need to move my deadlines if I have a really some...</p>
<h3>SPEAKER_01 <small>(18:11)</small></h3>
<p>Try to use store method like we just talked about...</p>
<h3>SPEAKER_01 <small>(18:16)</small></h3>
<p>So, situation.</p>
<h3>SPEAKER_04 <small>(18:17)</small></h3>
<p>Situation, if I cannot finish my task or my project and I understand the deadline is coming for the time and I need to...</p>
<h3>SPEAKER_04 <small>(18:30)</small></h3>
<p>information about management or clients where is a problem, why it's coming, a problem.</p>
<h3>SPEAKER_04 <small>(18:35)</small></h3>
<p>It's a lot of job or a lot of tasks about that, if I understand the question.</p>
<h3>SPEAKER_04 <small>(18:41)</small></h3>
<p>Or I need to have more help from the other advice with my expertise, not to hold this question or important.</p>
<h3>SPEAKER_04 <small>(18:54)</small></h3>
<p>And then it took communication from the team or communication for the management and told him what the situation.</p>
<h3>SPEAKER_04 <small>(19:06)</small></h3>
<p>But I don't know how I need to tell.</p>
<h3>SPEAKER_01 <small>(19:10)</small></h3>
<p>So let's just imagine the situation, right?</p>
<h3>SPEAKER_01 <small>(19:13)</small></h3>
<p>So what the problem situation you had before in your job experience working for it?</p>
<h3>SPEAKER_04 <small>(19:22)</small></h3>
<p>If you are not correct.</p>
<h3>SPEAKER_01 <small>(19:24)</small></h3>
<p>Did you face any issues during your</p>
<h3>SPEAKER_04 <small>(19:29)</small></h3>
<p>year? Yeah, but for the situation I do not experience for that. I have some deadline. I</p>
<h3>SPEAKER_04 <small>(19:39)</small></h3>
<p>know to finish the deadline. For all time, if there were some problems, we argument why we</p>
<h3>SPEAKER_04 <small>(19:47)</small></h3>
<p>do to change something like, or if it's very...</p>
<h3>SPEAKER_01 <small>(19:54)</small></h3>
<p>No, I'm just trying to</p>
<h3>SPEAKER_01 <small>(19:57)</small></h3>
<p>I'm just trying to align your transfer with this star method.</p>
<h3>SPEAKER_01 <small>(20:05)</small></h3>
<p>So I need to understand the situation, for example.</p>
<h3>SPEAKER_04 <small>(20:10)</small></h3>
<p>Just try it shortly.</p>
<h3>SPEAKER_04 <small>(20:11)</small></h3>
<p>If I have a deadline, I need to finish my task on the deadline for project.</p>
<h3>SPEAKER_04 <small>(20:18)</small></h3>
<p>If I cannot eat, I need to understand if that not correct.</p>
<h3>SPEAKER_04 <small>(20:24)</small></h3>
<p>argument about that deadline.</p>
<h3>SPEAKER_04 <small>(20:27)</small></h3>
<p>Second, it's something new coming.</p>
<h3>SPEAKER_04 <small>(20:29)</small></h3>
<p>It's about some problem that you don't correct.</p>
<h3>SPEAKER_01 <small>(20:35)</small></h3>
<p>You don't go with the Star method.</p>
<h3>SPEAKER_00 <small>(20:39)</small></h3>
<p>Maybe situation may be replaced with a context.</p>
<h3>SPEAKER_00 <small>(20:43)</small></h3>
<p>like first you give the context or was for example just just tell the context can you can you</p>
<h3>SPEAKER_02 <small>(20:49)</small></h3>
<p>um what is the original question yeah what was the very</p>
<h3>SPEAKER_01 <small>(20:54)</small></h3>
<p>how do you approach problem solving when working under tight deadlines</p>
<h3>SPEAKER_00 <small>(20:59)</small></h3>
<p>okay so the context maybe like we needed to implement a new feature</p>
<h3>SPEAKER_00 <small>(21:07)</small></h3>
<p>in four months.</p>
<h3>SPEAKER_00 <small>(21:10)</small></h3>
<p>This is a context.</p>
<h3>SPEAKER_02 <small>(21:11)</small></h3>
<p>This is a complex technical.</p>
<h3>SPEAKER_01 <small>(21:14)</small></h3>
<p>You start with situation,</p>
<h3>SPEAKER_01 <small>(21:16)</small></h3>
<p>giving me some information, what happened?</p>
<h3>SPEAKER_01 <small>(21:19)</small></h3>
<p>You've previously in your experience.</p>
<h3>SPEAKER_01 <small>(21:22)</small></h3>
<p>Then you move to situation to task.</p>
<h3>SPEAKER_01 <small>(21:26)</small></h3>
<p>So what do you need to do with this?</p>
<h3>SPEAKER_01 <small>(21:28)</small></h3>
<p>Right?</p>
<h3>SPEAKER_04 <small>(21:29)</small></h3>
<p>I'm more understanding more if I do not</p>
<h3>SPEAKER_04 <small>(21:33)</small></h3>
<p>can finish it in the deadline task.</p>
<h3>SPEAKER_01 <small>(21:37)</small></h3>
<p>No, situation you got...</p>
<h3>SPEAKER_00 <small>(21:40)</small></h3>
<p>Or a project manager came with a deadline.</p>
<h3>SPEAKER_00 <small>(21:42)</small></h3>
<p>It's a situation.</p>
<h3>SPEAKER_02 <small>(21:43)</small></h3>
<p>And it's a hard technical feature you need to implement.</p>
<h3>SPEAKER_01 <small>(21:48)</small></h3>
<p>It came with some new requirements that we didn't...</p>
<h3>SPEAKER_04 <small>(21:52)</small></h3>
<p>If I were wrong right thinking, I need to first research about that how it's time to implement the new feature.</p>
<h3>SPEAKER_01 <small>(22:02)</small></h3>
<p>So this is a task or what?</p>
<h3>SPEAKER_04 <small>(22:05)</small></h3>
<p>I think it's just for understanding the project</p>
<h3>SPEAKER_04 <small>(22:09)</small></h3>
<p>for understanding what we need to do.</p>
<h3>SPEAKER_01 <small>(22:15)</small></h3>
<p>what could be this task in that situation so project manager came to me with a new</p>
<h3>SPEAKER_01 <small>(22:20)</small></h3>
<p>requirements from the our stakeholders but we also fixed the deadlines we have to</p>
<h3>SPEAKER_01 <small>(22:29)</small></h3>
<p>reach to I don't know to release this enemy of course so this is a situation</p>
<h3>SPEAKER_01 <small>(22:34)</small></h3>
<p>yeah very cool situation very likely to me with the new requirements I'm</p>
<h3>SPEAKER_01 <small>(22:38)</small></h3>
<p>answering to each one for example task</p>
<h3>SPEAKER_01 <small>(22:41)</small></h3>
<p>So we need to refactor all the requirements, all the features and understand how can we implement it with the same deadlines and maybe put out some of the features and put in some new ones.</p>
<h3>SPEAKER_01 <small>(23:00)</small></h3>
<p>This is the task.</p>
<h3>SPEAKER_01 <small>(23:01)</small></h3>
<p>Number seven.</p>
<h3>SPEAKER_01 <small>(23:02)</small></h3>
<p>S, situation, tasks, then action.</p>
<h3>SPEAKER_01 <small>(23:05)</small></h3>
<p>What we did?</p>
<h3>SPEAKER_00 <small>(23:06)</small></h3>
<p>What we did?</p>
<h3>SPEAKER_00 <small>(23:07)</small></h3>
<p>And what was the result after?</p>
<h3>SPEAKER_01 <small>(23:09)</small></h3>
<p>What was the result?</p>
<h3>SPEAKER_01 <small>(23:10)</small></h3>
<p>So what we did?</p>
<h3>SPEAKER_01 <small>(23:11)</small></h3>
<p>We put out some of the features.</p>
<h3>SPEAKER_01 <small>(23:15)</small></h3>
<p>Put them away?</p>
<h3>SPEAKER_01 <small>(23:16)</small></h3>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<h3>SPEAKER_01 <small>(23:17)</small></h3>
<p>Agreed with our stakeholders.</p>
<h3>SPEAKER_01 <small>(23:19)</small></h3>
<p>Then we're going to replace</p>
<h3>SPEAKER_01 <small>(23:22)</small></h3>
<p>or new one with the old ones.</p>
<h3>SPEAKER_04 <small>(23:24)</small></h3>
<p>Changing other tasks or changing globalization and changing all the processes from the</p>
<h3>SPEAKER_01 <small>(23:28)</small></h3>
<p>And as the result, we matched</p>
<h3>SPEAKER_01 <small>(23:35)</small></h3>
<p>without that.</p>
<h3>SPEAKER_00 <small>(23:36)</small></h3>
<p>Or, for example, you can say</p>
<h3>SPEAKER_00 <small>(23:37)</small></h3>
<p>from the developer's perspective,</p>
<h3>SPEAKER_00 <small>(23:40)</small></h3>
<p>we took a similar part of another</p>
<h3>SPEAKER_00 <small>(23:43)</small></h3>
<p>project that matched...</p>
<h3>SPEAKER_00 <small>(23:45)</small></h3>
<p>Managed the team from the...</p>
<h3>SPEAKER_00 <small>(23:47)</small></h3>
<p>Yeah, that matched the task</p>
<h3>SPEAKER_00 <small>(23:48)</small></h3>
<p>and implemented quickly into our project,</p>
<h3>SPEAKER_00 <small>(23:52)</small></h3>
<p>so we managed it.</p>
<h3>SPEAKER_00 <small>(23:53)</small></h3>
<p>Focused on orders, so we pulled that through.</p>
<h3>SPEAKER_01 <small>(23:56)</small></h3>
<p>This is a really way of thinking,</p>
<h3>SPEAKER_01 <small>(23:58)</small></h3>
<p>I think.</p>
<h3>SPEAKER_01 <small>(23:59)</small></h3>
<p>This is a start, this is a really way of thinking</p>
<h3>SPEAKER_00 <small>(24:02)</small></h3>
<p>and you have to just plan.</p>
<h3>SPEAKER_00 <small>(24:03)</small></h3>
<p>And it's like a storytelling basically.</p>
<h3>SPEAKER_00 <small>(24:06)</small></h3>
<p>You give the context, you focus the interviewer's attention on what you did.</p>
<h3>SPEAKER_00 <small>(24:14)</small></h3>
<p>Give you a lot of information.</p>
<h3>SPEAKER_00 <small>(24:16)</small></h3>
<p>Makes some sense.</p>
<h3>SPEAKER_01 <small>(24:19)</small></h3>
<p>Okay, Adam, let's try.</p>
<h3>SPEAKER_00 <small>(24:21)</small></h3>
<p>Maybe it's your turn, no?</p>
<h3>SPEAKER_01 <small>(24:22)</small></h3>
<p>Oh, I'm a facility.</p>
<h3>SPEAKER_00 <small>(24:24)</small></h3>
<p>Okay, good.</p>
<h3>SPEAKER_00 <small>(24:26)</small></h3>
<p>So the number, the number.</p>
<h3>SPEAKER_00 <small>(24:28)</small></h3>
<p>What's the greatest number?</p>
<h3>SPEAKER_01 <small>(24:30)</small></h3>
<p>Eighty-two.</p>
<h3>SPEAKER_00 <small>(24:32)</small></h3>
<p>So let it be 72.</p>
<h3>SPEAKER_01 <small>(24:37)</small></h3>
<p>Okay, here we go.</p>
<h3>SPEAKER_01 <small>(24:39)</small></h3>
<p>Your regulatory requirement impacts your system.</p>
<h3>SPEAKER_00 <small>(24:45)</small></h3>
<p>The regulatory, I think.</p>
<h3>SPEAKER_01 <small>(24:47)</small></h3>
<p>Regulatory, sorry, yeah.</p>
<h3>SPEAKER_01 <small>(24:51)</small></h3>
<p>How would you assess the business impact?</p>
<h3>SPEAKER_01 <small>(24:58)</small></h3>
<p>Okay. Obviously,</p>
<h3>SPEAKER_00 <small>(25:01)</small></h3>
<p>The situation is clear.</p>
<h3>SPEAKER_00 <small>(25:04)</small></h3>
<p>So how would I assess?</p>
<h3>SPEAKER_00 <small>(25:07)</small></h3>
<p>Of course I would firstly go through the new regulatory requirements</p>
<h3>SPEAKER_00 <small>(25:13)</small></h3>
<p>and look really closely on what fines and what consequences it may take for a company if this company won't</p>
<h3>SPEAKER_00 <small>(25:26)</small></h3>
<p>be compliant with those regulatory.</p>
<h3>SPEAKER_01 <small>(25:28)</small></h3>
<p>You cannot discuss with regulatory.</p>
<h3>SPEAKER_00 <small>(25:31)</small></h3>
<p>No, no, of course I don't.</p>
<h3>SPEAKER_00 <small>(25:32)</small></h3>
<p>So I will just look through them and understand what are the consequences if those regulatory requirements are not met.</p>
<h3>SPEAKER_00 <small>(25:41)</small></h3>
<p>So this basically would be my reference point.</p>
<h3>SPEAKER_00 <small>(25:46)</small></h3>
<p>Maybe then I would understand how much work</p>
<h3>SPEAKER_00 <small>(25:52)</small></h3>
<p>we need to do. Maybe I'll address some technical teams, analysts, teams, I don't know, system analysts, whoever will be involved, yeah, to assess the effort needed to be compliant with these new regulators.</p>
<h3>SPEAKER_00 <small>(26:13)</small></h3>
<p>Okay. And that would be my scope basically and after that I will try to understand</p>
<h3>SPEAKER_00 <small>(26:19)</small></h3>
<p>Where can we maybe cut corners a bit so maybe we will it's always like that there is 80% of your effort covers 20% of your effort covers the 80% of</p>
<h3>SPEAKER_00 <small>(26:32)</small></h3>
<p>Outcome Paratoa law</p>
<h3>SPEAKER_00 <small>(26:35)</small></h3>
<p>Peritolo is a solid one</p>
<h3>SPEAKER_00 <small>(26:37)</small></h3>
<p>So I would understand</p>
<h3>SPEAKER_00 <small>(26:40)</small></h3>
<p>What we can do firstly to match 80% of these requirements.</p>
<h3>SPEAKER_00 <small>(26:48)</small></h3>
<p>And maybe what are the potential risks if we leave this remaining 20 uncovered?</p>
<h3>SPEAKER_01 <small>(26:54)</small></h3>
<p>Okay. Very nice answer. And that's it.</p>
<h3>SPEAKER_01 <small>(26:57)</small></h3>
<p>But you can go one more time with a Star Method, please.</p>
<h3>SPEAKER_00 <small>(27:00)</small></h3>
<p>Okay.</p>
<h3>SPEAKER_02 <small>(27:02)</small></h3>
<p>Actually, can Star Method be as an imaginary one?</p>
<h3>SPEAKER_02 <small>(27:08)</small></h3>
<p>Yeah, of course.</p>
<h3>SPEAKER_02 <small>(27:09)</small></h3>
<p>Yeah, sure. This is just for practice.</p>
<h3>SPEAKER_02 <small>(27:10)</small></h3>
<p>Because the question seems imaginary question, not something based on facts.</p>
<h3>SPEAKER_01 <small>(27:19)</small></h3>
<p>Are it possible question actually in interview?</p>
<h3>SPEAKER_02 <small>(27:23)</small></h3>
<p>Yeah, definitely.</p>
<h3>SPEAKER_00 <small>(27:24)</small></h3>
<p>So, um...</p>
<h3>SPEAKER_01 <small>(27:25)</small></h3>
<p>Okay, one more time.</p>
<h3>SPEAKER_01 <small>(27:26)</small></h3>
<p>And you're regulatory, regulatory or?</p>
<h3>SPEAKER_00 <small>(27:29)</small></h3>
<p>Regulatory.</p>
<h3>SPEAKER_00 <small>(27:31)</small></h3>
<p>Regulatory.</p>
<h3>SPEAKER_01 <small>(27:32)</small></h3>
<p>Regulatory.</p>
<h3>SPEAKER_00 <small>(27:33)</small></h3>
<p>No, regulatory.</p>
<h3>SPEAKER_00 <small>(27:34)</small></h3>
<p>Ah, regulatory.</p>
<h3>SPEAKER_01 <small>(27:36)</small></h3>
<p>And you, regulatory requirements impact your system.</p>
<h3>SPEAKER_01 <small>(27:39)</small></h3>
<p>How would you assess the business impact?</p>
<h3>SPEAKER_00 <small>(27:45)</small></h3>
<p>I would understand the technical side.</p>
<h3>SPEAKER_00 <small>(27:49)</small></h3>
<p>So...</p>
<h3>SPEAKER_02 <small>(27:51)</small></h3>
<p>The question actually is the situation already.</p>
<h3>SPEAKER_00 <small>(27:53)</small></h3>
<p>Yeah, the question is the situation.</p>
<h3>SPEAKER_02 <small>(27:55)</small></h3>
<p>So task is to assess.</p>
<h3>SPEAKER_01 <small>(27:57)</small></h3>
<p>But when you started with your story time,</p>
<h3>SPEAKER_00 <small>(27:58)</small></h3>
<p>Thank you for your time.</p>
<h3>SPEAKER_01 <small>(28:00)</small></h3>
<p>But when you start with story time, you have to refer to your real</p>
<h3>SPEAKER_00 <small>(28:07)</small></h3>
<p>experience.</p>
<h3>SPEAKER_00 <small>(28:08)</small></h3>
<p>Okay, let's imagine I have this experience.</p>
<h3>SPEAKER_00 <small>(28:12)</small></h3>
<p>So firstly I assessed the</p>
<h3>SPEAKER_00 <small>(28:17)</small></h3>
<p>impact in terms of resources we need to cover</p>
<h3>SPEAKER_00 <small>(28:23)</small></h3>
<p>to match this regulatory requirements.</p>
<h3>SPEAKER_00 <small>(28:26)</small></h3>
<p>In terms of lines of code, specialists we need to hire for this task.</p>
<h3>SPEAKER_00 <small>(28:36)</small></h3>
<p>And it was basically my point of reference in resources, how much do we need?</p>
<h3>SPEAKER_00 <small>(28:45)</small></h3>
<p>Then I understood where we can cut corners and what are the most, like, okay, I prioritized</p>
<h3>SPEAKER_00 <small>(28:57)</small></h3>
<p>these requirements based on their severity and impact for the business.</p>
<h3>SPEAKER_00 <small>(29:03)</small></h3>
<p>So from one side I tried to meet the regular solar requirements, from the other side,</p>
<h3>SPEAKER_00 <small>(29:08)</small></h3>
<p>I tried to save some money and resources for the company.</p>
<h3>SPEAKER_00 <small>(29:15)</small></h3>
<p>When everything was set and done, we made the necessary development and met these regulatory requirements</p>
<h3>SPEAKER_00 <small>(29:26)</small></h3>
<p>and left some of the points for later and included them in our backlog.</p>
<h3>SPEAKER_00 <small>(29:31)</small></h3>
<p>That's it.</p>
<h3>SPEAKER_01 <small>(29:33)</small></h3>
<p>Hi.</p>
<h3>SPEAKER_00 <small>(29:35)</small></h3>
<p>This was...</p>
<h3>SPEAKER_00 <small>(29:39)</small></h3>
<p>I had some practice during several months.</p>
<h3>SPEAKER_01 <small>(29:42)</small></h3>
<p>Yeah, yeah guys, of course if you don't want to go with this TAR method and practice,</p>
<h3>SPEAKER_01 <small>(29:46)</small></h3>
<p>you can just escape it's actually not for me, I just think it could be really useful for us.</p>
<h3>SPEAKER_00 <small>(29:54)</small></h3>
<p>It sounds much more solid I think when you use TAR method and you, even if it's imaginary, you say like it's already been done.</p>
<h3>SPEAKER_00 <small>(30:04)</small></h3>
<p>Like inside.</p>
<h3>SPEAKER_01 <small>(30:05)</small></h3>
<p>I realize that sometimes you can use some phrases that makes your speech more beautiful.</p>
<h3>SPEAKER_01 <small>(30:14)</small></h3>
<p>You know, I have the same experience of my previous workplace, as an example, just start with your storytelling.</p>
<h3>SPEAKER_01 <small>(30:23)</small></h3>
<p>So I had this situation when project manager came to me with it.</p>
<h3>SPEAKER_01 <small>(30:27)</small></h3>
<p>new requirements and that's of course, it's going to</p>
<h3>SPEAKER_01 <small>(30:31)</small></h3>
<p>support the group's representative.</p>
<h3>SPEAKER_01 <small>(30:32)</small></h3>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<h3>SPEAKER_01 <small>(30:33)</small></h3>
<p>Okay.</p>
<h3>SPEAKER_02 <small>(30:34)</small></h3>
<p>Um, 27.</p>
<h3>SPEAKER_01 <small>(30:37)</small></h3>
<p>27.</p>
<h3>SPEAKER_01 <small>(30:38)</small></h3>
<p>Okay.</p>
<h3>SPEAKER_01 <small>(30:41)</small></h3>
<p>All we need.</p>
<h3>SPEAKER_01 <small>(30:44)</small></h3>
<p>Um, okay.</p>
<h3>SPEAKER_01 <small>(30:45)</small></h3>
<p>Have you ever had to rework a project due to changing requirements?</p>
<h3>SPEAKER_01 <small>(30:54)</small></h3>
<p>Have you ever had to work a project due to changing requirements?</p>
<h3>SPEAKER_02 <small>(30:59)</small></h3>
<p>Actually, yes, all the time.</p>
<h3>SPEAKER_02 <small>(31:03)</small></h3>
<p>When I was a developer of games, we kind of trying to work in</p>
<h3>SPEAKER_02 <small>(31:14)</small></h3>
<p>with Agile methodology.</p>
<h3>SPEAKER_02 <small>(31:16)</small></h3>
<p>So we were doing small sprints in two weeks,</p>
<h3>SPEAKER_02 <small>(31:20)</small></h3>
<p>but usually we can start some new feature</p>
<h3>SPEAKER_02 <small>(31:24)</small></h3>
<p>and then realize that this feature should be tweaked somehow.</p>
<h3>SPEAKER_02 <small>(31:29)</small></h3>
<p>For example, after testing with players,</p>
<h3>SPEAKER_02 <small>(31:35)</small></h3>
<p>And in this situation, actually, I wasn't given tasks from anyone.</p>
<h3>SPEAKER_02 <small>(31:41)</small></h3>
<p>I was the one who assigned tasks to myself.</p>
<h3>SPEAKER_02 <small>(31:47)</small></h3>
<p>So I was trying to understand what is the correct way, correct direction to go and changing</p>
<h3>SPEAKER_02 <small>(31:56)</small></h3>
<p>the backlog of tasks.</p>
<h3>SPEAKER_02 <small>(32:02)</small></h3>
<p>continuing or starting to implement new tasks.</p>
<h3>SPEAKER_02 <small>(32:10)</small></h3>
<p>And it's very hard to assess what was the result</p>
<h3>SPEAKER_02 <small>(32:14)</small></h3>
<p>because when you start one thing and one change to another,</p>
<h3>SPEAKER_02 <small>(32:18)</small></h3>
<p>you can't assess what does the better.</p>
<h3>SPEAKER_01 <small>(32:22)</small></h3>
<p>And adapt to it.</p>
<h3>SPEAKER_02 <small>(32:28)</small></h3>
<p>You can imagine, you can...</p>
<h3>SPEAKER_01 <small>(32:31)</small></h3>
<p>I didn't catch action as a result and waiting for it.</p>
<h3>SPEAKER_02 <small>(32:37)</small></h3>
<p>Yes, I was trying to explain that, can you repeat the question again?</p>
<h3>SPEAKER_01 <small>(32:43)</small></h3>
<p>Have you ever had to rework a project due to change in requirements?</p>
<h3>SPEAKER_01 <small>(32:48)</small></h3>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<h3>SPEAKER_01 <small>(32:49)</small></h3>
<p>Thank you.</p>
<h3>SPEAKER_01 <small>(32:51)</small></h3>
<p>Situation?</p>
<h3>SPEAKER_02 <small>(32:56)</small></h3>
<p>Yes.</p>
<h3>SPEAKER_01 <small>(32:57)</small></h3>
<p>We were developing.</p>
<h3>SPEAKER_02 <small>(33:02)</small></h3>
<p>I was developing a game and for example,</p>
<h3>SPEAKER_02 <small>(33:08)</small></h3>
<p>I can start a feature, a new feature,</p>
<h3>SPEAKER_02 <small>(33:12)</small></h3>
<p>but during the development, it can turn out that this feature is not so good.</p>
<h3>SPEAKER_02 <small>(33:22)</small></h3>
<p>For example, after testing with players, we can realize that,</p>
<h3>SPEAKER_02 <small>(33:27)</small></h3>
<p>or the feature is not so good or...</p>
<h3>SPEAKER_01 <small>(33:30)</small></h3>
<p>Did it really happen?</p>
<h3>SPEAKER_02 <small>(33:31)</small></h3>
<p>Yes.</p>
<h3>SPEAKER_02 <small>(33:34)</small></h3>
<p>Or the implementation is not so good.</p>
<h3>SPEAKER_02 <small>(33:37)</small></h3>
<p>Not good enough.</p>
<h3>SPEAKER_02 <small>(33:40)</small></h3>
<p>we started to think how we can tweak it.</p>
<h3>SPEAKER_02 <small>(33:47)</small></h3>
<p>And usually we are trying to make low-cost changes</p>
<h3>SPEAKER_02 <small>(33:55)</small></h3>
<p>because we have kind of deadline, two weeks,</p>
<h3>SPEAKER_02 <small>(33:58)</small></h3>
<p>and we need to finish the feature during that date,</p>
<h3>SPEAKER_02 <small>(34:05)</small></h3>
<p>complete, yes.</p>
<h3>SPEAKER_02 <small>(34:12)</small></h3>
<p>result I was trying to say that it's very hard to assess results because when you change the feature and</p>
<h3>SPEAKER_02 <small>(34:20)</small></h3>
<p>deploying that new feature and you do for example a B test you measure only the new one you can't measure</p>
<h3>SPEAKER_02 <small>(34:28)</small></h3>
<p>what would be the results of that feature that you started</p>
<h3>SPEAKER_01 <small>(34:34)</small></h3>
<p>actually we don't talk about the results of the feature</p>
<h3>SPEAKER_01 <small>(34:38)</small></h3>
<p>as an action.</p>
<h3>SPEAKER_01 <small>(34:39)</small></h3>
<p>You talk about as a result of your actions, you need to use it.</p>
<h3>SPEAKER_02 <small>(34:42)</small></h3>
<p>Okay, if we talk, okay, if we talk about results.</p>
<h3>SPEAKER_02 <small>(34:48)</small></h3>
<p>Okay, the result, results was,</p>
<h3>SPEAKER_02 <small>(34:52)</small></h3>
<p>Time savings, for example.</p>
<h3>SPEAKER_01 <small>(34:54)</small></h3>
<p>Time savings and you aligned with the requirement, changed from the stakeholders.</p>
<h3>SPEAKER_02 <small>(35:00)</small></h3>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<h3>SPEAKER_01 <small>(35:00)</small></h3>
<p>This is that answer.</p>
<h3>SPEAKER_01 <small>(35:03)</small></h3>
<p>Yeah, right.</p>
<h3>SPEAKER_01 <small>(35:04)</small></h3>
<p>So I guess we're out of the time and the last question to this.</p>
<h3>SPEAKER_03 <small>(35:10)</small></h3>
<p>69.</p>
<h3>SPEAKER_01 <small>(35:12)</small></h3>
<p>69.</p>
<h3>SPEAKER_01 <small>(35:16)</small></h3>
<p>Okay, so stakeholders from different departments have conflicting priorities.</p>
<h3>SPEAKER_01 <small>(35:25)</small></h3>
<p>How would you resolve this?</p>
<h3>SPEAKER_03 <small>(35:28)</small></h3>
<p>Okay, first of all, I, when I meet the situation when different stakeholders have conflicting environments.</p>
<h3>SPEAKER_01 <small>(35:39)</small></h3>
<p>Did you make this situation?</p>
<h3>SPEAKER_03 <small>(35:41)</small></h3>
<p>Yes.</p>
<h3>SPEAKER_01 <small>(35:42)</small></h3>
<p>So you can start with situation.</p>
<h3>SPEAKER_03 <small>(35:44)</small></h3>
<p>Okay.</p>
<h3>SPEAKER_03 <small>(35:48)</small></h3>
<p>On the previous work, for example.</p>
<h3>SPEAKER_03 <small>(35:50)</small></h3>
<p>On my previous work, I had this situation when different stakeholders had conflicting requirements.</p>
<h3>SPEAKER_03 <small>(36:03)</small></h3>
<p>And first of all, I gathered from them their requirements, their view of these requirements.</p>
<h3>SPEAKER_03 <small>(36:10)</small></h3>
<p>Then I have analyzed it.</p>
<h3>SPEAKER_03 <small>(36:12)</small></h3>
<p>And</p>
<h3>SPEAKER_03 <small>(36:17)</small></h3>
<p>found out so</p>
<h3>SPEAKER_03 <small>(36:20)</small></h3>
<p>key conflicting points and then I wrote them about this conflicting place and after that I suggested</p>
<h3>SPEAKER_03 <small>(36:36)</small></h3>
<p>them to have a meeting to discuss together this conflict point and during this</p>
<h3>SPEAKER_03 <small>(36:45)</small></h3>
<p>discuss we</p>
<h3>SPEAKER_03 <small>(36:50)</small></h3>
<p>prioritized some requirements or choose alignable to their goal.</p>
<h3>SPEAKER_03 <small>(37:05)</small></h3>
<p>Okay, so and as a result, conflict was resolved.</p>
<h3>SPEAKER_03 <small>(37:16)</small></h3>
<p>And we received a list of requirements that all stakeholders approved.</p>
<h3>SPEAKER_01 <small>(37:31)</small></h3>
<p>Okay. So, but you can say like as a result we just did something so reach our</p>
<h3>SPEAKER_01 <small>(37:40)</small></h3>
<p>project goals, product goals released something and I don't know.</p>
<h3>SPEAKER_00 <small>(37:45)</small></h3>
<p>One more tip in the results section. It's a good idea to add some quantifiable results. Let's say</p>
<h3>SPEAKER_00 <small>(37:54)</small></h3>
<p>Yeah, profit increased.</p>
<h3>SPEAKER_01 <small>(37:55)</small></h3>
<p>It's very difficult and...</p>
<h3>SPEAKER_01 <small>(37:56)</small></h3>
<p>Save time by 30%</p>
<h3>SPEAKER_00 <small>(37:57)</small></h3>
<p>Yeah, yeah, something like this.</p>
<h3>SPEAKER_00 <small>(37:59)</small></h3>
<p>It can be complete bullshit, of course.</p>
<h3>SPEAKER_00 <small>(38:02)</small></h3>
<p>In reality.</p>
<h3>SPEAKER_00 <small>(38:04)</small></h3>
<p>But it's just a cool tip to understand.</p>
<h3>SPEAKER_00 <small>(38:08)</small></h3>
<p>And be prepared, of course, if they ask you how you calculated it.</p>
<h3>SPEAKER_03 <small>(38:11)</small></h3>
<p>Yeah, and maybe sometimes, next time we will tell about some...</p>
<h3>SPEAKER_03 <small>(38:22)</small></h3>
<p>Quantity achievements?</p>
<h3>SPEAKER_00 <small>(38:25)</small></h3>
<p>Quantifiable.</p>
<h3>SPEAKER_03 <small>(38:26)</small></h3>
<p>Quantifiable achievements and how you assess them.</p>
<h3>SPEAKER_03 <small>(38:32)</small></h3>
<p>Assessed them.</p>
<h3>SPEAKER_03 <small>(38:34)</small></h3>
<p>Because it's very difficult topic for me.</p>
<h3>SPEAKER_03 <small>(38:38)</small></h3>
<p>I can't imagine how to choose what measure, how measure.</p>
<h3>SPEAKER_01 <small>(38:44)</small></h3>
<p>It's difficult, but it's possible.</p>
<h3>SPEAKER_00 <small>(38:46)</small></h3>
<p>It is possible.</p>
<h3>SPEAKER_00 <small>(38:47)</small></h3>
<p>You can say my manager told me.</p>
<h3>SPEAKER_00 <small>(38:52)</small></h3>
<p>It's very easy answer if you are not a manager yourself.</p>
<h3>SPEAKER_00 <small>(38:55)</small></h3>
<p>Well, my manager told me we achieved that goal.</p>
<h3>SPEAKER_01 <small>(38:58)</small></h3>
<p>Okay guys, I was satisfied with that.</p>
<h3>SPEAKER_01 <small>(39:00)</small></h3>
<p>I think we can finish for today.</p>
<h3>SPEAKER_01 <small>(39:02)</small></h3>
<p>We're out of time.</p>
<h3>SPEAKER_01 <small>(39:03)</small></h3>
<p>We did a huge work.</p>
